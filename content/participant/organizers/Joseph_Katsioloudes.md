notes: 
Joseph simplifies security for developers at GitHub Security Lab. He chose this career path because from a very young age, security was his own way to provide ethical and dedicated service to organisations and the society as a whole. Previous presentation experience include GreHack, EkoParty and guest lecturing at Imperial College London's Web Security course for Master students and University of Warwick MSc Cyber Security.

His most recent contributions to our ecosystem include the YouTube series â€œ#SecurityBites" where he educates developers on common software vulnerability patterns. Other highlights include 2 engineering degrees with focus in software and security, a zero-day vulnerability for a Top 10 Cryptocurrency in 2018 and open-source contributions to Intelligence & Blockchain.
